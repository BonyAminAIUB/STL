# C++ STL Practice 📦

This repository contains **practice implementations of C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**
along with some **basic searching and sorting algorithms**.

It is created as part of my learning journey to understand how STL containers,
strings, and fundamental algorithms work in competitive programming and DSA.

- Competitive programming examples

---

## ⚠ Note
This is a **learning repository**, so code is written for
**understanding and practice**, not for full optimization.
